Exercise- 7 CLI Tool

In this exercise I have build the CLI tool which manages your TODO's list. Used third-party library i.e Cobra to add commands in CLI tool. Used boltDB to store the data. Added 3 coomands:-
1. add - which adds the task in list & store the same in DB also.
2. list - Which fetch the tasks from DB & list down.
3. do - Which delete the task from DB i.e it marked the task as complete.
